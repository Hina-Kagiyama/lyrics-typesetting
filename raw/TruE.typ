Say my name when a tree susurrates

Once and again telling a story lost in time

--

The way it starts and the way it ends

Never again making up stories in dismay

--

With several starts, but just one end

Ah, how I long to embrace

--

The future breaking out of shades from the past

Still ablaze

--

Save your tears for the day so far away

To irrigate the wilderness that's still asleep

--

In the world waiting to be lit

To spread over the riverbeds, so dry and dead

--

Let ships that ran aground re-launch their sails

Ah, how I long to embrace

--

The future breaking out of shades from the past

Still ablaze

--

Seeds bear new life when flowers dare to fade

Petals linger about

Awaiting one last dance

--

Shaking off all the dust from the past

New stories have yet to start
