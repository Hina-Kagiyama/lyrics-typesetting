[Verse 1]

Legends aren't born that way

But by deeds

Bloodlines denotes nothing

How do towering trees grow from a seed?

And achievements rise from the ash?

We endure and suffer, lose and bleed

Still we clash against the sky

--

[Chorus]

You and I are weak like the reeds

But chasing flames is carved into creed, oh

Cleave the darkness, and seize the light

Daybreak's meant to be free

We are gonna shatter the ties

--

[Verse 2]

Time's worn away the lives

And bygones

Leaving faith to resound

Behold all the pioneering souls

In the gloom, they strive to flash

Though the journey’s filled with wounds and tolls

Still we clash against the sky

--

[Chorus]

Let's defy the judgment of flaws

Would rather die than kneel down or crawl, oh

Cleave the darkness, and seize the light

Daybreak's meant to be free

We are gonna shatter the ties

--

[Bridge]

(Ooh, ooh)

(You and I are still gonna touch the sky)

(You and I, we are gonna pay the price)

(You and I, sleep like a butterfly), (Oh, oh, oh, ohh)

--

[Chorus]

You and I are weak like the reeds (Oh)

But chasing flames is carved into creed, oh

Cleave the darkness, and seize the light

A brand new dawn's within reach

We are gonna make it untied
